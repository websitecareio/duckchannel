## Why a duck
The question "Why a duck?" invites us to consider the various ways in which ducks (and other things) can be meaningful or significant, and to think about the underlying reasons for this significance... or simply put... Why not a duck.

## Purpose of this
I do not have a TV, instead i use a projector to watch content and i wanted a way to select what i wanted to watch without having to turn on my pc every time i wanted to watch something. My solution was to use a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB loaded with "Duck Streamtab" and the content it then will send to the projector via. wifi (streaming) or as HDMI output (depending what i can get working best).

A notes section have been added because i switch streaming services all the time and cannot remember what episode i stopped at, and not all services remember what i have watched. Now i can just write where i was.

Images:
There are some images for streaming services made, but you will need to get your own permissions to use them. You can use any image if you want, just by entering a different URL. YOu can find the images in the directory /images/

## Built with
It is made with HTML and Javascript using bootstrap to make sure it worked on all devices.

90% of this have been made with the use of Chat GPT (ChatGPT Dec 15 Version) to test is functionality and how much it can do. My work here was mostly combining the code.

## Features
* Export all streaming services
* Import data
* Remove all data
* Add and remove notes

## Backup backup backup
Remember to backup your data by using the export data function. In case you clear your browser data, it will be lost because data are stored in local storage.
By having the export data, you can import it again if needed by using the import data function.

## Testing
This code havent been tested yet. So might not work very well.
